//* take some structs as input, and produce a file that matches the specification given
//*There's also a tip in this week's lab – when working with a FILE pointer obtained from a file descriptor, you might need to call fflush (see man fflush) to "write out" those buffers. The buffers are automatically written out when a FILE pointer is closed with fclose; but if you have a FILE pointer you created yourself (e.g. with fdopen) that just goes out of scope, then you may need to flush the buffers before your function exits.
//* use fread and fwrite
//* If you have a file descriptor, but need a FILE* (or vice versa) – check out the fdopen and fileno functions for converting between the two.
//* If reading or writing from a FILE*, it’s a good idea to call fflush before finishing the current function – especially if the FILE* was obtained using fdopen, since it may contain buffered input or output that hasn’t yet been fully read or written."

/*
 Let's break down the expression `struct ItemDetails *currentItem = &(*ptr)[i];` step by step:

1. **`(*ptr)`**: `ptr` is a pointer to a pointer to `struct ItemDetails`. When you dereference `ptr` with `*ptr`, you get a pointer to `struct ItemDetails`.

2. **`(*ptr)[i]`**: Now that we have a pointer to `struct ItemDetails`, we can treat it as an array of `struct ItemDetails`. We use the indexing operator `[]` to access the `i`-th element of this array. So, `(*ptr)[i]` gives us the `i`-th `struct ItemDetails` object in the array pointed to by `*ptr`.

3. **`&(*ptr)[i]`**: Next, we take the address of the `i`-th `struct ItemDetails` object using the address-of operator `&`. This gives us a pointer to the `i`-th `struct ItemDetails` object.

4. **`struct ItemDetails *currentItem = &(*ptr)[i];`**: Finally, we assign the address of the `i`-th `struct ItemDetails` object to the pointer `currentItem` of type `struct ItemDetails *`.

So, after this line of code, `currentItem` is a pointer to the `i`-th `struct ItemDetails` object in the array pointed to by `*ptr`.*/
